# About this site
My name is Mihály Koltai. This website contains some material on my academic work in mathematical biology as well as some other interests I have.

# Interests

Since 2010 I have worked on the mathematical modelling of biological systems, first in systems biology and more recently in infectious disease epidemiology.

I obtained PhD from Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg (Germany) in 2012. [My thesis](https://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/volltextserver/20847/) was on the mathematical modelling of microbial signalling pathways.
I am currently a research fellow in the [Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases (CMMID)](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres/centre-mathematical-modelling-infectious-diseases) at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

To see published work in mathematical biology [click here](https://mbkoltai.github.io/papers/) and for posts on the same topic [here](https://mbkoltai.github.io/blog/).

Sometimes I also write about [economic and political topics](https://mbkoltai.github.io/ecopol), trying to combine qualitative social theory with quantitative thinking.

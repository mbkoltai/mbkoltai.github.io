# Interests

I have worked on mathematical modelling of biological systems since 2010, in the fields of systems biology and infectious disease modelling.

I obtained a PhD from Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg (Germany) in 2016 with [a thesis on](https://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/volltextserver/20847/) quantitative modelling of microbial signalling pathways.
After my PhD I worked at Institut Curie (France), at LSHTM (UK) and currently at Imperial College London (UK).

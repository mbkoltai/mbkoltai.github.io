# About this site
My name is Mihaly Koltai, I am a research scientist and this is a website on my work in mathematical biology as well as some other interests I have.

# Interests

Since 2010 I have worked on mathematical modelling of biological systems, applied to molecular biology (systems biology) and to infectious diseases (infectious disease modelling).

I obtained a PhD from Ruprecht-Karls-Universit√§t Heidelberg (Germany) in 2012 with [a thesis on](https://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/volltextserver/20847/) mathematical modelling of microbial signalling pathways.
I am currently a research fellow in the [Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases (CMMID)](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres/centre-mathematical-modelling-infectious-diseases) at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, working on transmission modelling of infectious diseases.

For published work in mathematical biology [click here](https://mbkoltai.github.io/papers/) and for posts on the same topic [here](https://mbkoltai.github.io/blog/).

Occasionally I also write about [economic and political topics](https://mbkoltai.github.io/ecopol), trying to combine qualitative social theory with quantitative thinking.

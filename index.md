# About this site
My name is Mihály B. Koltai and this is a website on both my professional work in systems biology and some of my other interests.

# Interests

Since 2010 I have worked in the field of systems biology, ie. the mathematical modeling and quantitative analysis of biomolecular systems.

I did [my PhD](https://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/volltextserver/20847/) in computational/mathematical biology in Heidelberg (Germany), and I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the [Computational Systems Biology of Cancer](https://sysbio.curie.fr) group at [Institut Curie](https://institut-curie.org) in Paris.  

You can read about my published work in systems biology [here](https://mbkoltai.github.io/papers/) and posts on related topics [here](https://mbkoltai.github.io/blog/).

From time to time I also write on economic and political topics [here](https://mbkoltai.github.io/ecopol), where I try to combine qualitative social theory with quantitative analysis.

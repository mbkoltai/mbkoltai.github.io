# About this site
My name is Mihaly Koltai, I am a research scientist and this is a website on my scientific work as well as some other interests I have.

# Interests

I have worked on mathematical modelling of biological systems since 2010, in the fields of systems biology (modelling cells) and infectious disease modelling.

I got my PhD from Ruprecht-Karls-Universit√§t Heidelberg (Germany) in 2012 with [a thesis on](https://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/volltextserver/20847/) quantitative modelling of microbial signalling pathways.
After my PhD I worked at Institut Curie (France), at LSHTM and (currently) at Imperial College London.

For published work in mathematical biology [click here](https://mbkoltai.github.io/papers/) and for posts on scientific topics [here](https://mbkoltai.github.io/blog/).

I also have an interest in economics, politics and some other topics, for posts on these click on one of the sub-pages in the header.

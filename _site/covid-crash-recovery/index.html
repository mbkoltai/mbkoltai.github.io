<p>Last February I wrote an <a href="https://mbkoltai.github.io/illusion-globalisation/">article</a> on whether the shock of the pandemic could unravel the global economy and perhaps the whole system of globalisation. From long-term estimates of economic growth I tried to show that the globalisation of the last 30-40 years was on a different scale than previous cycles of expansion of global trade and finance.
Since this huge and burst-like expansion of global trade and finance coincided with a similar expansion of private and public debt, I speculated if the system was more fragile than we might expect and might start to disintegrate as the pandemic hits it on a systemic level, not isolated to certain sectors or regions like in previous crises of the last decades. This disintegration has so far not happened. Before going into the reasons why, let us look at the scale of economic fallout from the pandemic and how governments have reacted in response.</p>

<h2 id="2-the-crash-and-the-response"><ins>2. The crash and the response</ins></h2>

<h3 id="crash"><ins>Crash</ins></h3>

<p>The world economy shrank by <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2021/01/26/2021-world-economic-outlook-update">around 3.5%</a> in 2020 while world trade fell <a href="https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/ditcinf2021d1_en.pdf">by 9%</a>.
This is slightly worse than in 2009 for GDP (<a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG">-1.7%</a>), but less severe for world trade which fell by
<a href="https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/g8g20/the-great-recession-and-international-trade/">12%</a> in 2009. Whatever the exact numbers are, the headline figures for 2009 and 2020 are comparable.<br />
Business as usual for globalisation? Of course it is still early days, and it would take longer for a process of disintegration to work its way through the world economy. But for the moment at least a general de-globalisation does not seem to be happening, in fact some countries have already <a href="https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/g8g20/the-great-recession-and-international-trade/">started increasing</a> their trade again, most notably <a href="https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/ditcinf2021d1_en.pdf">in East Asia, spearheaded by China</a>, that successfully eliminated the virus.
The COVID19 recession is very different from previous ones. A state-imposed demobilisation of the economic system occurred in the form of lockdowns and other, milder non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Output fell, in the first instance at least, because the state intentionally switched off certain sectors, such as retail and tourism/hospitality.</p>

<p>The size of the recession varied depending on how long and severe NPIs were maintained, the size of countervailing government intervention and trend growth prior to the pandemic.<br />
There are a few countries struggling with civil wars, government default and/or large-scale disasters that seem to have experienced what could be described a collapse of economic activity (measured as GDP): Lybia (-67%), Lebanon (-25%) and Venezuela (-25%), followed by a few tourism-based mini-states. The contraction was <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDP_RPCH@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD">more than 10% for some Latin American countries</a> (Peru, Argentina) and Spain that were hit hard by the pandemic and were fiscally constrained. The fallout was around 10% for the worst hit European countries (UK, Italy, France) and India that applied (too late) harsh lockdowns without succeeding to stem mass infections and therefore were locked into cycles of relaxing and re-introducing NPIs.
Japan, Germany, Brazil, the US, Australia/NZ and Eastern Europe saw recessions of around 5%, for different reasons ranging from unconstrained fiscal intervention, higher trend growth and (probably) manufacturing exports less affected than services.
Many African countries showed a mild recession to modest growth (-2 to +2%), but the Maghreb countries as well as South Africa and its neighbours experienced a bigger than 5% contraction. China and Vietnam were two countries that managed to suppress or prevent a mass outbreak and hence sustained a +2% expansion which is still 5% under their trend growth.
To summarise, the contraction of GDP was the most severe in Europe, Latin America and India, while in East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa the contraction was smaller or a low growth rate was even sustained.</p>

<h3 id="response"><ins>Response</ins></h3>

<p>To make up for the fall in spending within these sectors and the income loss of employees many states picked up most of the wage bill and implemented various stimulus measures of increasing benefits, one-time down payments to households, as well as emergency loans and loan guarantees for businesses.</p>

<p>The size of stimulus measures in 2020 significantly exceeded those in 2009. The exact numbers will depend on what is defined as part of the ‘stimulus’ on top of baseline spending, so absolute values are probably sensitive to methods.
Looking at numbers relative to 2009, according to the definition used by <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Public%20Sector/Our%20Insights/The%2010%20trillion%20dollar%20rescue%20How%20governments%20can%20deliver%20impact/The-10-trillion-dollar-rescue-How-governments-can-deliver-impact-vF.pdf">McKinsey</a> the size of the measures as a percentage of GDP increased 10-fold from 2009 to 2020 in Western European countries, Japan, Brazil and India, and around 3-5 fold for Canada and the USA.
According to the IMF’s breakdown of stimulus measures by type, <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Fiscal-Policies-Database-in-Response-to-COVID-19">much of them</a> were loans, loan guarantees and equity support and not direct spending. Nevertheless the spending increase itself was also about 12% of GDP in advanced economies (using the IMF’s definition). There is a big difference with emerging/middle income economies (EMMIE) where this figure was around 4% of GDP and low income countries where it was 1.5% on average.
Liquidity support was on average at the same level for advanced economies as additional spending, but in some countries such as Germany, Japan and Italy it was even higher, more then 30% of GDP, whereas in EMMIEs and low income countries liquidity support was smaller than the increase in spending.
It was at the cost of this unprecedented fiscal and monetary intervention that the state-led demobilisation of much of the economy did not lead to a collapse of national income.
By definition this means that government debt grew, reaching 100% of GDP globally, 10% above the projections made in 2019.
Fiscal intervention was one aspect of government interventions, but there was another one: monetary stimulus by central banks. Once again the money supply was significantly expanded, led by the Fed, but also the BoE, the ECB and the BoJ.<br />
One major difference from 2009 was that while at that time the largest stimulus was applied by China, which included both direct spending and (even more so) expansion of credit to industry via its state-controlled banking sector, this time China implemented a (proportionally) smaller stimulus program than Europe and the US. This is mainly because lockdowns in China were much shorter and the fact that no ‘furlough’-type programs of general wage support had to be applied.</p>

<h2 id="3-what-now"><ins>3. What now?</ins></h2>

<h3 id="pandemic-prospects"><ins>Pandemic prospects</ins></h3>

<p>Vaccination programs are currently going ahead in Europe and North America and projected to cover most adults by the 4th quarter of 2021, in many Western European countries, as well as the USA and Canada more than 70-80% of adults are already vaccinated (by at least one dose), and vaccination of adolescents have now started.
The countries which managed to prevent or suppress outbreaks (in East Asia, Australia/NZ) were under less pressure to act quickly but also started their vaccination roll-outs while keeping their borders shut.
Poor countries have much less access to vaccines so far, with Africa around a 2% vaccination rate by July 2021, Latin America around 40% and Asia around 30%.
Seroprevalence studies from urban areas of India, Pakistan and South Africa showed perhaps one-third to half of the adult population in cities already infected, forming a level of population immunity, which is not enough however for infections to fall with the more contagious variants that appeared in 2021 and large outbreaks re-appeared from the spring of 2021, and are currently continuing through the summer. In late July 2021 some of these outbreaks, for instance in India and North Africa, are now again shrinking that could be a sign of population immunity.
Immune escape by new variants could undermine these calculations, but vaccines are likely to provide protection against severe disease at least, and the timescale of adapting vaccines to new strains will likely become much shorter too.
A global coordination to eliminate COVID19 by synchronised lockdowns and travel bans seems unlikely both for political and technical reasons. In summary, the likeliest scenario is that vaccination will soon provide protection for the majority of the population in high income countries. Meanwhile in lower income countries higher population immunity due to infections, a multi-year vaccine roll-out and the much lower median age will keep the disease burden at a lower, but not negligible level. No reliable mortality statistics are available from most low income countries, but <a href="https://github.com/dkobak/excess-mortality">excess deaths (per population) estimates</a> for South Africa are higher than for most of Europe and in Egypt comparable. In Manaus, Brazil, the closest thing we have to an unmitigated epidemic on a large-scale, excess death estimates suggest 0.4% of the total population died (this was before the outbreaks from the summer of 2021).</p>

<p>On the other hand, while IFR rates were lower for the entire population because of lower median age (Egypt: 25 years, Brazil: 33 years, UK/France/Italy: 40-47 years) they are often higher when comparing with the matching age groups in high-income countries, because of lack of access to health care and widespread co-morbidities.
Putting the epidemiology aside, and going with the scenario that vaccine programs and population immunity will keep the disease burden at a level below where governments should re-introduce strong NPIs, an economic recovery started in most countries in the second half of 2020 and so far continuing in 2021.</p>

<h3 id="recovery"><ins>Recovery</ins></h3>

<p>Most larger economies have now switched back to positive growth rates and it seems there will be a strong recovery of GDP figures in 2021. In the United States the large fiscal and monetary stimulus is estimated to result in GDP not only recovering from the recession but reverting back to the pre-pandemic GDP trend line. There is talk of inflationary pressures and shortages causing supply chain disruptions. These are probably after-effects of the sudden shocks during the pandemic. Will these wear off or might they interact in a way to amplify each other and disrupt the recovery? I don’t think anybody knows, economic models do not seem to be able to make reliable forecasts due to the complexity of the problem: both data and model structure are incomplete to make predictions with high confidence. The default forecast for the moment however is a recovery for this year and growth continuing in 2022.<br />
Critical events might derail this. For one thing, there has been a massive buildup of corporate debt even before the pandemic since the 2009 recession:
<img src="https://thenextrecession.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/fin-3.png?w=500&amp;h=400" alt="_config.yml" /></p>

<p>During the pandemic a lot of businesses were kept on a government lifeline - most of this is debt and since ‘re-opening’ is unlikely to be a complete return to normality for some industries such as travel and hospitality (if not because of regulations than behavioral change), it is an open question if there will not be a chain of bankruptcies in 2021-22, which could start a new private debt crisis, perhaps this time starting from corporate debt, rather than housing and collateralised household (mortgage) debt as in the 2008 great recession (GR).<br />
Another potential time-bomb could be the eurozone, as in the 2010s following the first phase of the financial crisis: in the case of Greece government debt to GDP was ‘only’ around 110% in 2008 (jumping to ~140% by 2010, and ~170% by the mid-2010s, following austerity policies), but now it is 206%. There has been a similar increase for Italy and Spain and indeed almost all EU countries. The difference is that this time, finally, the EU took a step towards debt mutualisation and national recovery programs will be to some extent funded by jointly raised debt. This makes a run on Greek (etc.) debt less likely, but does it make it impossible? The recovery program does not seem to be big enough (~300 billion euros in direct spending over a 7-year period, that is around 0.3% of the EU’s annual GDP) to generate much growth on its own and much of Southern Europe seemed stagnant already before the pandemic. Now tourism is still to a large extent shut down and unlikely to completely recover this year. Where will growth come from in Southern Europe and if it does not come, will these countries not face revenue problems that could cascade into a new sovereign debt crisis? If this does not happen and yields stay low and interest payments manageable on Southern European government debt, this would be a further argument to support the view that the Eurozone debt crisis of the 2010s was avoidable and self-imposed by the inept and dogmatic policies of the EC/Eurogroup/ECB.<br />
It is unclear if the European Commission (or whoever calls the shots on economic policies in the EU) has changed its views on what makes a recovery sustainable and would be willing to extend stimulus if growth rates slump or would it switch back to austerity policies as in the early 2010s.<br />
The UK might also experience a further shock if full custom controls with the EU are finally switched on: these were put off to October 2021 and some until January 2022. Disruption to trade with the EU have so far not been that significant (ie. seem to be recovering to the pre-2020 trendline), but this might change when full customs checks start to be applied. Nevertheless the effect so far looks more like a moderate drag on growth rather than a shock that could push the UK into recession. As long as there is ‘faith’ in the sterling and the government can borrow cheaply, the UK does not look like a domino likely to fall, thought its growth rate might no longer exceed that of the Eurozone as it <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdp-per-capita-worldbank?tab=chart&amp;stackMode=relative&amp;time=2000..latest&amp;country=Euro+area~GBR">mostly did</a> 2000-2016.<br />
An interesting question is why China was more cautious (or less bold) in its stimulus spending than during the GR. Was it simply because it did not <em>need</em> to do more for its economy to rebound because of the rapid suppression of COVID-19 and its economy now less dependent on exports or is there something more to this? If it is the latter, that ‘something’ could be (undisclosed) problems in the Chinese banking sector that makes the government not wanting to put more strain on it by forcing banks to up the credit supply.<br />
Finally, there has been a <a href="https://www.iif.com/Portals/0/Files/content/IIF20200408_MN.pdf">large outflow of funds</a> from ‘emerging markets’, much more so than in the first 1-2 years of the GR. While lower and middle income countries have run up government deficits much less than high income ones, their debt level  still increased, typically in the range of 5-10%, because of lost revenue and (modestly) increased spending. Medium-sized countries like Turkey, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico or Indonesia with a history of sovereign debt crises saw their debt levels rise and it is a question if the currency or the banking sector might snap in some of them if capital flows do not return to their pre-pandemic level and too much debt cannot be rolled over or interest rates on debt spike.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-globalisation"><ins>What about globalisation?</ins></h3>

<p>Whether the recovery will be sustained for at least the coming 1-2 years or not, in retrospect I feel there were more fundamental problems with my <a href="https://mbkoltai.github.io/illusion-globalisation">arguments</a> on the fragility of globalisation.
The structure of the argument was the following. Globalisation on the current scale is recent, it mostly happened since the second world war and especially in the last 40-50 years - more a sudden explosion than gradual growth over centuries. Although there had been some degree of globalisation ever since the sixteenth century (and by some measures even before, for millennia), the cumulative growth of the last eighty years in terms of volumes of goods/services sold internationally, of global economic output and energy use is (much) larger than what had occurred over several centuries pre-1945.
In the last forty years of explosive growth of financial and trade globalisation there has also been a secular growth of all forms of debt, especially in the wealthy countries: corporate, household and public debt all rose to a level several times of annual output. The two long business cycles (1992-2000, 2001-2007) before the GR have been notoriously debt-driven, especially in the United States and Europe (think of Southern Europe, the UK, Ireland…), but also parts of Asia and Latin America. The 1992-2000 cycle was marked by a debt-fueled stock market bubble (dotcom bubble) and the second by unprecedented housing bubbles and debt-financed household consumption. Employment growth for the more recent business cycles was <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/job-growth-greater-than-in-2001-2007-ended-in-march-2020-4">weaker</a>, and the <a href="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/761/90/sites/default/files/20190706_WOC339_1.png">same</a> <a href="https://investors-corner.bnpparibas-am.com/economics/graph-of-the-week-the-new-mediocre/">goes</a> for output growth, with the long business cycle following the GR (2009-2020) the weakest of all by both metrics.<br />
In short, what I argued was that global trade networks expanded so fast that supply chains have become too stretched and many economies too dependent on trade, while all sources of demand (consumer, business and government spending) are too reliant on debt - so that when the system was hit by simultaneous shutdowns of much of the global economy it might not have enough resilience to weather this and there could be an implosion in globalisation unlike any since its emergence.<br />
While there was a roughly 5-10% contraction in output and trade in 2020, it was comparable to that of 2009 and following government interventions there has been a strong rebound.
There are now shortages in some goods (chips) but overall supply chains of multinational companies could manage the shock of lockdowns: a 10% reduction in economic activity is not a collapse, and in fact it was mainly services, not manufacturing that was shut down. The idea that the shock was too ‘systemic’, so corporations will not be able to cope was therefore somewhat of a ‘handwavy’ argument. In reality they could respond appropriately, at least with the help of governments. It is true that without government loans, grants, subsidies there might have been a true collapse, but government intervention to keep the economic system ticking was essential in the GR already. Overall, the system was robust enough to weather the storm.
The debt hangover from government interventions might still be a problem, either in the form of unviable businesses not being able to pay back loans or sovereign debt crises. If that happens, we could say the problem was just put off but not sold and the global economic system <em>was</em> too fragile and debt-ridden.</p>

<p>But in a more general sense I think the line of argument was faulty: the fact that globalisation arose very rapidly and that a lot of debt has been built up since the 1990s does not imply it is a system that is inherently fragile and potentially might collapse when perturbed by a large shock like the pandemic. First of all, complex systems often emerge in a burst and exponential growth is small initially. The institutional, legal and cultural basis for global trade had been there for a much longer time, and it was the new information technology, regulatory frameworks for trade, finance and investment and cheaper shipping and travel that made the explosion after the second world war and again from 1980s possible. But burst-like growth does not mean a system is unstable: a sigmoidal curve has a first part that looks exponential but then it saturates.
Now, I still believe the world economy is unstable inasmuch there is strong interdependence across markets and a mountain of debt in the world economy, so there would be periodic debt crises that spread rapidly. But this does not mean the system is close to a tipping point where it might collapse, if by collapse we mean a sustained fall in activity of at least 30-50%. While some Marxist economist claim profitability is at a record low currently, nominal <a href="https://www.schroders.com/en/uk/private-investor/insights/markets/how-european-corporate-profits-powered-ahead-in-q1/">corporate</a> <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/corporate-profits">profit</a> <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/corporate-profits">figures</a> seem to be recovering (Q1-Q2 2021). Even with more ‘<a href="https://thenextrecession.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/fore206.png">zombie companies</a>’ around the recovery should go ahead at least in the short term.</p>

<p>That is for the macroeconomics in the short term. There is however climate change and the need for an energy transition. Could this be the ‘systemic’ crisis that tears down globalisation?
This question implies trying to make predictions about the climate, the world economy and political reactions at the same time - the complexity is so high it is doubtful even qualitative predictions are possible. Nevertheless I will try some, while emphasising the following are really speculations.<br />
It is unlikely the response to the climate crisis will be sufficiently timely: it is already happening with forests burning in unusual locations. Targets for decarbonisation have been recently set by the major economies, with China setting a target of emissions <em>peaking</em> by 2025-2030 and reductions only afterwards. Overall the targets set timelines of emission reductions that seem too slow by one or two decades to avert &gt;2C warming. Burning coal, probably the worst form of fossil fuel consumption, will still be going <em>up</em> for at least several years (around 5% currently), though for net zero emissions a yearly reduction of around 5% would be needed.<br />
So the likeliest scenario would be the climate crisis getting worse: more extreme weather events, summer heat waves and forest fires. But these changes are likely to be woven into the fabric of a globalised capitalist economy instead of totally disrupting it: mitigating the climate crisis will create various new industries and new forms of population control.
The pandemic might be a dressing rehearsal in this sense as well: the precedent is now set for the state to drastically intervene and close down cities or even countries and ramp up surveillance. In the climate crisis moving populations and (probably quite violent) forms of migration control will likely become part of the normal functioning of the state. The climate emergency, higher fuel costs and more home-working might result in somewhat less travel and perhaps more regionalisation of the world economy.
But travel and migration for highly qualified professionals and of course for the rich are unlikely to be controlled or reduced.<br />
More broadly, cultural globalisation based on universal internet and smartphone use will likely continue, along with the spread of English. The secular decline in political participation (turnout at elections, party and union membership) will also likely proceed, further hollowing out Western liberal democracies, where the state will become more and more a technocratic and regulatory apparatus and the general population caring less about such things while an apolitical, individualistic and hedonistic consumer attitude becomes ever more deeply entrenched. This does not mean there will not be flare-ups of potentially violent forms of political protest, but these will likely be short-lived single-issue protest movements along the ‘Gilets Jaunes’ model:  ideologically heterogeneous and confused, operating by memes and generally anti-political (‘they are all bastards’ etc) without creating organisational structures - and therefore likely to be short-lived.<br />
In countries where political pluralism has only weak roots in society there will likely be a move towards ‘managed democracies’ along the lines of Russia or Hungary, with a hegemonic government party adeptly using broadcast media and the internet as well as surveillance to keep opposition groups marginal enough so that open forms of repression is only occasionally needed. While one of these parties might fall, it is unlikely this will lead to a general upsurge of political participation, instead they will be replaced by another oligarchic group. Consent is bought by the state providing some level of stability and support for the least well-off outside the metropolitan centres along with culture wars against the ‘woke’ West and metropolitan liberals, while those within the city gates are allowed to pursue a lifestyle of Westernised consumption patterns or opt for emigration.</p>

<p>In the global South climate change might be truly catastrophic because of the effects of rising temperatures on both human physiology and agriculture. This will increase migratory pressure on the West, and in the intermediate zones around Europe especially (North Africa, Middle East). Repressive states in this buffer zone will likely get more funding from the West in exchange for holding back migrants by force.</p>

<p>Overall, I would expect global trade and information technologies to survive under conditions of the climate crisis too, though perhaps in a changed form. Travel and migration for elites and ‘essential’ professionals (engineers, doctors etc.) will probably be secured, but might be more curtailed for the bulk of the population. In this respect the travel bans of the pandemic could prove to be useful precedents for states to point to.</p>
